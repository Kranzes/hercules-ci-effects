Hi, and thank you for suggesting a contribution!

The following is my own checklist. If you can tick all boxes, great! If not, I might be able to help.

### Maintainer checklist

Please don't remove any items, but leave them unchecked, even if they don't apply.

 - [ ] Documentation (function reference docs, setup guide, option reference docs)
 - [ ] Has tests (VM test, free account, and/or test instructions)
 - [ ] Is the corresponding module up to date?

= `nix-shell`

_nix-shell {two-colons} { shell } -> String -> String_

A `nix-shell` invocation with pre-built environment.

Pre-building the environment has the following advantages:

* Build failures will cancel the effect before it starts.
* Dependencies will be cached and metadata is available in the dashboard.
* You don't have to worry about bringing Nix files into the sandbox.
* You can reference any variables you have defined in your Nix file.
* In-effect execution is instant.

Example:

[source,nix]
----
include::example$nix-shell.nix[]
----

The `effects.nix-shell` interface is simpler than `nix-shell`, because it does
not need the flags for build and evaluation.

== Parameters

[[param-run]]
=== `run`

The bash command to run; `nix-shell --run`.

[[param-shell]]
=== `shell`

The derivation that represents the `nix-shell` environment to run.

A basic example would be:

```nix
nix-shell { shell = pkgs.mkShell { /* ... */ }; } ""
```

or in a flake:

```nix
nix-shell { shell = self.devShell.${system}; } ""
```

Often, the shell will be in a separate file. If you don't mind evaluating the
same sub-expressions twice:

```nix
nix-shell { shell = import ./shell.nix; } ""
```

For more efficient evaluation, you can share the Nixpkgs invocation.

Suppose your `shell.nix` looks like:

```nix
let
  config = { };
  pkgs = import ./nixpkgs { inherit config; };
in
  pkgs.mkShell { /* ... */ }
```

You can change `shell.nix` to:

```nix
let
  config = { };
in
{ pkgs ? import ./nixpkgs { inherit config; } }:
  pkgs.mkShell { /* ... */ }
```

And reuse `pkgs` in the invocation:

```nix
nix-shell { shell = import ./shell.nix { inherit pkgs; }; } ""
```

[[return-value]]
== Return value

A string containing a bash statement.

The string context will refer to `nix`, the built shell dependencies and the shell derivation.
